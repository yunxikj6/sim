 * Moving a workspace between organizations is the only operation in the product
 * capable of separating an artifact from the organization that owns it, so two
 * invariants that nothing else has ever had to defend are enforced here.
 *
 * **A custom block and its bound workflow always share an organization.**
 * `publishCustomBlock` refuses a workflow outside the target org, so the pair
 * has always been co-located. `getCustomBlockAuthority` resolves by the
 * *consumer's* org and `admitCustomBlockChildExecution` deliberately skips its
 * concurrency reservation because "the consumer and source workspaces are always
 * in the same organization" — a stranded row would run a foreign tenant's
 * workflow under its owner's credentials, billed to the wrong payer. The move
 * therefore unpublishes every source-org block bound to the moving workspace.
 *
 * **A fork parent and child always share an organization.** `assertCanFork`
 * pins the child to the source's org, and `resolveForkEdge` has no org check at
 * all. The move refuses to run while a cross-org edge would result; the fork
 * must be disconnected first.
 *
 * Neither invariant tolerates a transitional or "inert" violation.
